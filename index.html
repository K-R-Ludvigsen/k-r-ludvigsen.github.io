       <h1>Kaspar Rosager Ludvigsen, Law/Cybersecurity PhD Student</h1>
   Danish lawyer (jurist), PhD is the intersection between law and cybersecurity + themes that surround IoT/CPS/HCI at the University of Strathclyde in Scotland. Yes, I can read math due to my weird background on top of being a lawyer, and yes, I too dislike that law has not adopted formal logic yet.
   <p>My current advisors are <a href="https://www.strath.ac.uk/staff/reviecrawforddr/">Crawfor Review</a> and <a href= "https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/persons/birgit-schippers">Birgit Schippers</a>.
    
    My past advisors were: <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Z2g9YhAAAAAJ"> Professor Shishir Nagaraja</a> and <a href="https://www.dundee.ac.uk/people/angela-daly">Professor Angela Daly</a>.</p>
   
   My affiliations for this position are <a href="https://www.strath.ac.uk/science/computerinformationsciences/">the Department of Computer & Information Sciences</a>, <a href="https://www.strath.ac.uk/humanities/lawschool/centreforinternetlawandpolicy/">Centre for Internet Law and Policy</a> and 
   <a href="https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/organisations/strathcyber">Strathcyber</a>.

   I am also Research Associate at the University of Newcastle, where I work in the <a href="https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/organisations/strathcyber">Cyber and Resilience centre</a>.
   This work is related to the PETRAS RoasT-IoT project.

   <p>I am vividly interested and proficient in <b>any kind of law</b>, current working areas are many, some would be European Law, "cyberlaw", medical device regulation, public law and torts and their equivalents.</p>
   <p> In cybersecurity, I am both very intrigued and interested in the general methodology and understanding of it, as well as the epistemology of attacking and defending, and really any type of attack and defence, and some safety engineering areas that touch security. 
    Like above, it is really everything, but see my publications for my current obsessions.</p>
