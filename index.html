       <h1>Kaspar Rosager Ludvigsen, Law/Cybersecurity PhD Student</h1>
   Danish lawyer (jurist), PhD is the intersection between law and cybersecurity + themes that surround IoT/CPS/HCI at the University of Strathclyde in Scotland. Yes, I can read math due to my weird background on top of being a lawyer, and yes, I too dislike that law has not adopted formal logic yet.
   <p>My advisors are <a href="https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/persons/shishir-nagaraja"> Reader Shishir Nagaraja</a> and <a href="https://www.dundee.ac.uk/people/angela-daly">Professor Angela Daly</a>.</p>
   Affiliations are <a href="https://www.strath.ac.uk/science/computerinformationsciences/">the Department of Computer & Information Sciences</a>, <a href="https://www.strath.ac.uk/humanities/lawschool/centreforinternetlawandpolicy/">Centre for Internet Law and Policy</a> and 
   <a href="https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/organisations/strathcyber">Strathcyber</a>.
   <p>I am vividly interested and proficient in <b>any kind of law</b>, current working areas are many, some would be European Law, "Cyberlaw", medical device regulation, public law and torts and their equivalents.</p>
   <p> In cybersecurity, I am both very intrigued and interested in the general methodology and understanding of it, as well as the epistemology of attacking and defending, side-channel attacks and social engineering. Like above, it is really everything, but see my publications for my current obsessions.</p>
